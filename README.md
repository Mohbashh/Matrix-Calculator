# Matrix-Calculator
Simple matrix calculator with a tkinter GUI.
I createrd this so I could get an introduction to using python, tkinter, and numpy. This my first attempt at using these technologies 
This calculator will do the following: "Matrix Multiplication", "Matrix Addition", "PDP Factorization", "LU Factorization", "QR Factorization", "Cholesky Factorization"
